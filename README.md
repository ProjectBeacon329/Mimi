mina# Project-Mercury
Webapp for Mimi's Cookiez
This project is dedicated to helping Mimi's Cookiez, a local bakery specializing in gourmet delicacies, optimize its operations by building a dynamic cost and pricing model. Mimi’s Cookiez offers a variety of baked goods, including specialty cookies, traditional cookies, brownies, and trendy items like croissant cookies and Dubai chocolate bars. By leveraging high-quality ingredients, Mimi ensures premium products, but this also presents challenges in maintaining optimal profit margins.

Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to develop a dynamic Python-based application that empowers Mimi's Cookiez to:

Accurately calculate the cost per item for all product categories.
Provide data-driven pricing recommendations.
Analyze profit margins and sensitivity to ingredient cost fluctuations.
Streamline reporting through automation.
Key Features
Dynamic Cost Model:

Calculates the cost per item based on the ingredient list, quantities used, and batch sizes.
Allows for real-time adjustments to account for changes in ingredient prices or production variables.
Dynamic Pricing Calculator:

Recommends pricing strategies by considering production costs, target margins, and competitive benchmarks.
Sensitivity Analysis:

Assesses how variations in ingredient costs or batch sizes impact unit costs and overall profitability.
Margin Trackers:

Provides an overview of profitability by product category and sales channel (e.g., farmers' markets, catering, or commercial orders).
Automation Features:

Automates reporting, pricing updates, and cost recalculations to minimize manual effort.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for building the cost model.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations in cost and pricing calculations.
APIs and Integration:
GitHub: For version control and collaborative development.
Potential future integration with web-hosting platforms like Vercel or Heroku for user-facing interfaces.
Hosting Options Considered
After evaluating several hosting platforms, the app is designed with scalability and ease of use in mind. Potential hosting platforms include:

Vercel: Ideal for a responsive front-end interface.
AWS Lambda: For scalable, serverless back-end functions.
Heroku: A straightforward solution for small to medium-sized projects.
Development Workflow
Ingredient and Recipe Analysis:

Gather a comprehensive list of ingredients and their costs.
Define batch sizes and recipes for each product category.
Model Design and Build:

Develop a Python script to dynamically calculate costs, pricing, and margins.
Include modules for sensitivity analysis and automated reporting.
Testing and Validation:

Validate the cost model using real data from Mimi’s current operations.
Perform edge case testing to ensure robust performance.
Deployment and Hosting:

Deploy the final model as a user-friendly web application for easy access and real-time updates.
Future Enhancements
Ingredient Database Integration: Automatically fetch ingredient prices from suppliers or external APIs.
Scalability Features: Enhance the app to support expansion into new product categories or sales channels.
Machine Learning Models: Predict customer demand and optimize inventory management.
Why This Project Matters
By providing Mimi's Cookiez with a detailed and dynamic understanding of costs and margins, this project will:

Improve decision-making for pricing strategies.
Enhance profitability by identifying inefficiencies.
Save time through automation, enabling Mimi to focus on scaling the business and delighting customers.
